The "Matrix Multiplication" code evaluates the impact of multi-threading on matrix multiplication tasks. 

Using Python libraries like NumPy, threading, and Pandas, the project generates random matrices and measures the execution time of matrix multiplication with varying numbers of threads (1 to 14). 

The results are analyzed and visualized to understand how concurrency affects performance.
